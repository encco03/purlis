          "message": "Secret scan: a prefilter in front of the vendor and personal-data rules; linear-time tests compare sizes\n\nLane VA (#773) took the per-line rules from 9 vendor and 3 personal-data\npatterns to 63 and 12, each run over every line. On PR #1800\nmany_escaped_addresses_and_many_joined_lines_read_in_linear_time took 14.66 s\nand then 14.54 s against its 10 s bound.\n\nEach gitleaks rule now carries its keywords, as gitleaks' own rules do, and one\nRegexSet of them, read case-insensitively, says which vendor rules a line can\nhold; the personal-data rules are asked once as a RegexSet for the same. Only\nthose rules run. No rule or check changes: the_prefilters_never_hide_a_hit\nholds the prefiltered scan to the scan asking every rule over every planted\nvalue, near-miss, personal datum and two source files, upper-cased and with\nthe long s and Kelvin sign a (?i) rule folds.\n\nThe four linear-time tests the scan owns now time a size and four times it,\nthree rounds each, and fail when the larger takes 8 times as long or more\n(linear is 4, quadratic 16), under a 120 s ceiling. Turning escaped_leaks' seen\nset into a list fails two of them (8.9x and 13.1x).\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nAssisted-by: claude-code:claude-opus-5-5\nPurlis-Chat: 01M4AREQXXRGBAEWM0SZ0N0WBN\nPurlis-Persona: steward",
